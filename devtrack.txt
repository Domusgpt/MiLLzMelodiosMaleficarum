Okay, here are concise prompts summarizing each of the four future development tracks, suitable for putting on a virtual "canvas" or in separate development tickets:

1. LLM Sound Design Integration

Track: Natural Language Sound Design

Goal: Enable users to describe desired sounds via text input (e.g., "ethereal pad", "punchy bass").

Approach: Implement an API-based workflow. Frontend sends description to a backend, which queries an LLM (e.g., GPT, Claude) using engineered prompts. LLM returns synth parameter JSON. Backend validates/sends JSON to frontend, which applies settings to SoundModule.

Key Challenges/Tasks: Backend setup, LLM API integration & cost management, Robust prompt engineering, JSON validation, Frontend UI for input/feedback, Latency handling.

2. Synthesizer Engine Expansion

Track: Core Synth Enhancements

Goal: Dramatically increase sonic flexibility and sound quality.

Key Features:

Oscillators: Add OSC2 (+ Mix, Detune, Sync), Sub Oscillator, Wavetable support, Noise Generator.

Filters: More types (HP, BP, Notch), dedicated Filter ADSR Envelope.

Modulation: Implement LFOs (multiple, shapes, targets) and a Modulation Matrix.

Effects: Add more built-in effects (Chorus, Phaser, Distortion).

Voicing: Introduce Polyphony & Unison modes.

Interface: Add visual feedback (Scope, Spectrum), improve parameter grouping, add MIDI input.

3. Custom Asset Integration (Images)

Track: User Assets & Personalization

Goal: Allow users to incorporate their own images for visual and sonic purposes.

Primary Uses:

Visualizer Backgrounds/Textures: Load JPEGs/PNGs as WebGL textures (sampler2D) to blend with or replace generated visuals. Modulate texture display with audio.

Wavetable Synthesis: Read image pixel data (e.g., brightness along a line) to create unique oscillator waveforms.

UI Skinning: Use images for custom UI elements (knobs, backgrounds).

Tasks: Image loading/validation, WebGL texture handling, Canvas pixel data processing (for wavetables), UI component updates.

4. Visualizer Evolution & Expansion

Track: Advanced Visualizations

Goal: Explore diverse and more complex visual representations beyond the current geometry/projection system.

Potential Directions:

Mathematical: Different high-D shapes, 3D/4D Fractals, Strange Attractors, Reaction-Diffusion patterns.

Physics-Based: Advanced particle systems (forces, flocking, collisions), Fluid simulations modulated by audio.

Rendering: Ray Marching (SDFs), Video Feedback Loops, Advanced Post-Processing (Bloom, DOF).

Data-Driven: Direct audio spectrum/waveform visualizations (e.g., terrains), abstract network graphs.

Immersive: WebXR (AR/VR) integration.

Interaction: Allow direct user manipulation of visual parameters (camera, properties).

These should provide clear starting points for planning and tracking the development of each feature area.
